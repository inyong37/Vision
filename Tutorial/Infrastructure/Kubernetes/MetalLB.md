# MetalLB

MetalLB hooks into your Kubernetes cluster, and provides a network load-balancer implementation. In short, it allows you to create Kubernetes services of type LoadBalancer in clusters that donâ€™t run on a cloud provider, and thus cannot simply hook into paid products to provide load balancers.

It has two features that work together to provide this service: address allocation, and external announcement.
